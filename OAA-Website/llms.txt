## Open Agent Alliance Manifesto

### Mission

The Open Agent Alliance is a shared commitment to make the future of AI agents
and assistants open, user-owned, and globally available to all while fairly
rewarding its builders.


### Core Beliefs

- We believe that users should own their data.
- We believe that AI is a public good.
- We believe that agents should be economic actors, offering more than just
information.

- We believe that privacy is a right to be protected.
- We believe that open source contributors should be rewarded.
- We believe that working together beats working alone every time.

### Our Method

Our goal is to create an open ecosystem where AI assistants seamlessly
integrate into daily life as economic actors, empowering users while
protecting their rights and privacy.


In order to accomplish this, members of our alliance will be non-exclusively
offering:


- A simple fiat on-ramping and off-ramping system designed for non-crypto
users, aiming to reach 10 times the current crypto user base.

- Front-end applications with built-in user bases that can leverage AI
assistants.

- A secure hosting infrastructure that minimizes agent creation and deployment
costs—making it free when possible—while monetizing open-source models and
providing physical hardware protection across all platforms.

- A set of physical hardware providers that can be leveraged by any hosting
platform in a default state secure way, protected from even physical attacks.

- An agnostic discovery system enabling any platform to find agents from any
participating hosting platform.

- Open-source developer kits that enable the community to build features
rapidly and learn from each other.

- A chain-agnostic payment system that fairly compensates all contributors at
each step.


Our alliance welcomes new members in all these categories, as we believe open
and communal systems consistently prevail.


## Alliance Info

A groundbreaking collaboration of forward-thinking teams including
**NEAR AI** and **Coinbase Onramp & Agent Kit**
announced the launch of the **Open Agent Alliance (OAA)**,
an initiative to deliver powerful, open AI services to all users by combining
infrastructure. By uniting secure infrastructure, innovative payment rails,
and cutting-edge AI technology, the OAA teams’ shared mission is to ensure
secure, open source, economical, and fair AI access for humanity — prioritizing
user privacy and economic inclusivity for over 5.5 billion web users worldwide.


“As the global web continues to shift toward mobile users, we believe AI must
be accessible to everyone,” said Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR AI.
“In partnership with leaders in hosting, privacy, and payments, we’re building
a globally distributed network that can provide AI services securely,
confidentially, and at no cost to end users. This effort spans far beyond
the current 350 million blockchain users, extending the power of crypto to
deliver accessible AI tools to all.”


Through the OAA, participating organizations will offer end-to-end solutions—
including an agentic AI framework, cloud and TEE-based hosting, and
frictionless on/off-ramps to both fiat and crypto. By allowing developers
to seamlessly build and deploy AI, and by sharing revenue with hardware
and software providers, the Alliance is paving the way for free AI inference
at scale. This united front aims to replace the traditional “pay-to-play”
model with a user-first approach for the benefit of all.

## Additional Info

#### What is the Open Agent Alliance (OAA)?

A global alliance of teams devoted to free (within reason) AI access for over
5.5 billion internet users, no matter who they are or what amount of wealth
they have.


Created to replace outdated payment systems and centralized AI offerings,
ensuring everyone can benefit from next-generation AI tools, while all
providers can collaborate communally to result in the best experience for
the user.


#### Key Components & Partnerships

##### End-to-End Payment & On/Off-Ramps

- Coinbase and others provide simple fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat pathways.

- NEAR AI enables seamless conversion into USDC on Base, and then into USDC on
NEAR at little or no cost using their intents system.

- Future-proof, chain-agnostic payment rails that reward all contributors—
frontends, developers, kit development teams, hardware providers, hosting
services—while keeping AI inference free for users.


##### Hosting & Infrastructure

- NEAR AI offers a developer-friendly environment for deploying and hosting
agents, handling all back-end complexity.

- NEAR AI is leading an open source and private “agent cloud” that uses
decentralized infrastructure so developers can deploy easily and securely.

- Phala integrates TEE-based confidentiality for user data.
- Hyperbolic, Aethir, and Akash supply the high-performance GPUs for large-scale
